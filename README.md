# Risk_Return Analysis
This is a Pandas quantitative analysis aimed at evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in client's investment portfolio. In order to determine a fund with the most investment potential the following key risk-management metrics were considered : the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas. This analysis was performed on historical data of four portfolios and the broader stock market represented by the S&P 500 covering the period 1 October 2014 to 11 September 2020.

## Methodology and Approach
-Performance analysis: to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market by derterming the daily rate of returns for the various portfolios.

-Volatility analysis: to establish the  volatility of each of the four fund portfolios and of the S&P 500 Index by using visualizations.

-Risk analysis: to evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio by using the standard deviation and the beta.

-Risk-return profile: to determine the overall risk of the  portfolio using  the Sharpe ratios for each portfolio.

-Portfolio diversification: to evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market and recommend possible investment options.


## Libraries and Technologies Used

-Pandas library -  a Python library for data analysis. 

-Matplotlib - a Python plotting library for vusualizations  

-Jupyter notebook

-NumPy- for numrical computational tools.


## Summary of findings 
The analysis produced two  possible investment options from which the client would chose for inclusion to their investment portfolio based on their risk appetite.  The recommended portolios both offered better risk-return profile and exibited low sensitity to the broader market.
